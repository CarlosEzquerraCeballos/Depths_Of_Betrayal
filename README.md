## Concept  
*Depths of Betrayal* is a multiplayer, 3D murder mystery game set in a dark, expansive underwater cave. Up to 5 players take on the roles of different characters in a single match. The game draws inspiration from titles like *Subnautica*, *Garry’s Mod (TTT)*, and *Dead by Daylight*.

## Setting  
The game takes place in a treacherous underwater zone known for mysterious shipwrecks and strange events. The single map is large, featuring a multi-leveled cave system with tight passageways and hidden areas that only skilled divers can access. The eerie atmosphere is enhanced by dim lighting and immersive sound effects, which create a sense of suspense and danger. If successful, future updates could introduce additional maps for more variety.

## Gameplay

### 1. Character Selection  
Players first choose their characters before being introduced to the game’s lore and rules by a scientist, standing at the edge of a cliff. This introduction is accompanied by an animated cutscene.
   
### 2. Game Start  
Once the intro finishes, players dive into the ocean and begin the game. One player is randomly selected to become the monster, a creature capable of switching between human and monster forms at will. The monster's goal is to devour the other players. The monster’s backstory ties to the lore: the water is contaminated, transforming them into this creature.

### 3. Objective for Humans  
The non-monster players must complete a mission to collect a set number of glowing crystals and deliver them to one of three designated locations. According to the lore, these crystals help purify the water. Once all crystals are collected, the monster temporarily reverts to human form, and the players must reach an extraction point to win the game. If all players escape, they win.

### 4. Monster Mechanics  
The monster has special abilities, including transforming at will and attacking other players. Its goal is to eat all the players, and if successful, the monster wins. Players eaten by the monster may return as a fish to spectate the game. The monster moves faster when swimming but can be slowed after making a kill. Cooldowns and additional abilities may be added to balance gameplay.

## Game Perspective  
- All players except the monster view the game in the first-person perspective.  
- The monster uses a third-person view when transformed to better hunt down its prey.

## Technical Details  
- Characters are created using *MakeHuman*, while *Blender* and *Unity* are used for modeling and animating both the monster and other game assets.
- Sound design includes a subtle ambient soundtrack to evoke tension, with louder, more intense audio cues when the monster is near. Think of Pyke’s ultimate sound from *League of Legends* for inspiration.

## Additional Features  
- The game includes normal and fast swimming modes, with limited stamina to balance movement. Speed boosts and monster slowdowns may be introduced during certain situations.
